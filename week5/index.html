				<h3> Thirst No.1</h3>
				<h5>By Christopher Pike</h5>
				<p><b>
					 At five thousand years old, the vampire Alisa thought she was smart enough to stay out of trouble. But when her creator returns to hunt her, she must protect herself by befriending Ray, the boy who may be her only chance at finding her maker. When she begins to fall in love with Ray, all of a sudden there is more at stake than her own life.

				<h3>Thirst No.2</h3>
				<h5> By Christopher Pike</h5>
				<p><b> 
					What Alisa has desired for five thousand years has finally come trueâ€”she is once again human. But now she is defenseless, vulnerable, and for the first time in centuries, emotional. As she attempts to reconcile her actions as a vampire with her new connection to humanity, she begins to understand the weight of life and death decisions. Can Alisa resolve her past and build a new identity, or is she doomed to repeat her fatal mistakes?
